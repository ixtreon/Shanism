### ShanoRpg

ShanoRpg is a highly extendable top-down 2D RPG game and a platform. It is written entirely in C# and all of the scripting is done in C#, too, (ab)using the powers of the [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/Roslyn) compiler. 

For additional information please refer to the Github [wiki](https://github.com/ixtreon/ShanoRPG/wiki).
